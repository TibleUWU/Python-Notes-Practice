Not sure what to put here.

Uhh, learning Git. Learning Python. Learning.
Lots of it!

update: I should probably tell y'all what resource I'm using to learn.
https://www.learnpython.org/
They also have numerous other tutorials for different languages but I'm using the Python one rn.
Once I get through this one, I'll probably seek other other resources to learn.
